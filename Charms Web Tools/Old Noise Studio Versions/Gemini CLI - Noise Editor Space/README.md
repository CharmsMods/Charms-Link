# Digital Grain Studio

This project is a refactored version of the original `v9.html` file, now split into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for better organization and maintainability.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: Contains all the CSS rules for styling the web page.
- `script.js`: Contains all the JavaScript logic for the interactive elements and image processing.

## How to Use

To open this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. All original functionality from the `v9.html` file has been preserved.
