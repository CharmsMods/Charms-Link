   - Improved blur algorithm with better performance
   - Saturation controls with separate noise impact adjustment

## 3. MASKING SYSTEM:
   - Advanced shadow/highlight masking:
     * Independent enable/disable for shadows and highlights
     * Adjustable threshold and fade controls
     * Visual feedback for mask areas
   - Transparency masking:
     * Option to ignore transparent areas
     * Adjustable strength for alpha channel handling
   - Real-time mask preview in layer view

## 4. IMAGE PROCESSING:
   - Full image adjustment suite:
     * Brightness (-100% to +100%)
     * Contrast (-100% to +100%)
     * Saturation (-100% to +100%)
   - HDR emulation:
     * Tolerance control (0-1)
     * Amount adjustment (0-100%)
   - Non-destructive adjustments with real-time preview

## 5. USER INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Collapsible sections for better organization
   - Contextual controls (shows/hides based on selections)
   - Real-time parameter feedback
   - Responsive layout for different screen sizes
   - Improved touch support
   - Keyboard-accessible controls

## 6. WORKFLOW ENHANCEMENTS:
